This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# Calculate 3 + 4
3 + 4


```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

#Arithmetic with R
In its most basic form, R can be used as a simple calculator. Consider the following arithmetic operators:

Addition: +
Subtraction: -
Multiplication: *
Division: /
Exponentiation: ^
Modulo: %%
The last two might need some explaining:

The ^ operator raises the number to its left to the power of the number to its right: for example 3^2 is 9.
The modulo returns the remainder of the division of the number to the left by the number on its right, for example 5 modulo 3 or 5 %% 3 is 2.
With this knowledge, follow the instructions to complete the exercise.

```{r}
# An addition
5 + 5 

# A subtraction
5 - 5 

# A multiplication
3 * 5

 # A division
(5 + 5) / 2 

# Exponentiation
2^5

# Modulo
28 %% 6
```

#Variable assignment
A basic concept in (statistical) programming is called a variable.

A variable allows you to store a value (e.g. 4) or an object (e.g. a function description) in R. You can then later use this variable's name to easily access the value or the object that is stored within this variable.

You can assign a value 4 to a variable my_var with the command

my_var <- 4

```{r}
# Assign the value 42 to x
x <- 42

# Print out the value of the variable x
x
```

Variable assignment (2)
Suppose you have a fruit basket with five apples. 
As a data analyst in training, you want to store the number of apples in a variable with the name my_apples

```{r}
# Assign the value 5 to the variable my_apples
my_apples <- 5

# Print out the value of the variable my_apples
my_apples
```

Variable assignment (3)
Every tasty fruit basket needs oranges, so you decide to add six oranges. As a data analyst, your reflex is to immediately create the variable my_oranges and assign the value 6 to it. Next, you want to calculate how many pieces of fruit you have in total. Since you have given meaningful names to these values, you can now code this in a clear way:

my_apples + my_oranges

```{r}
# Assign a value to the variables my_apples and my_oranges
my_apples <- 5
my_oranges <- 6

# Add these two variables together
my_apples + my_oranges

# Create the variable my_fruit
my_fruit <- my_apples + my_oranges
```


#Basic data types in R
introduce the data types
R works with numerous data types. Some of the most basic types to get started are:

1. Decimal values like 4.5 are called numerics.
2. Whole numbers like 4 are called integers. Integers are also numerics.
3. Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE) are called logical.
4. Text (or string) values are called characters.
5. Note how the quotation marks in the editor indicate that "some text" is a string.

```{r}
# Change my_numeric to be 42
my_numeric <- 42

# Change my_character to be "universe"
my_character <- "universe"

# Change my_logical to be FALSE
my_logical <- FALSE
```

##check the data type
What's that data type?
Do you remember that when you added 5 + "six", you got an error due to a mismatch in data types? You can avoid such embarrassing situations by checking the data type of a variable beforehand. You can do this with the class() function, as the code in the editor shows

```{r}
# Declare variables of different types
my_numeric <- 42
my_character <- "universe"
my_logical <- FALSE 

# Check class of my_numeric
class(my_numeric)

# Check class of my_character
class(my_character)

# Check class of my_logical
class(my_logical)

```
